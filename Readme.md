Asynchronous Web API Test
=========

The point of this app is to try out asynchronous networking in android.

It asks the user for a Github username, and uses the Github API to
asynchornously fetch a list of repos for that user.

The UI is updated with a spinning circle, and then with the results
list, and it's all done in quite an elegant way.
